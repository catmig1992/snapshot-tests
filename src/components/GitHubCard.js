          Hello!
          <br />I am an American-born Filipino from Los Angeles County who
          graduated from CSU Long Beach with a business degree. Currently, I
          have decided to expand my skills and knowledge in a new field - web
          development!
          <br />
          Creating web pages has been a fun experience and as I travel along my
          education and career journey I am excited for what the future will bring.
          <br />
