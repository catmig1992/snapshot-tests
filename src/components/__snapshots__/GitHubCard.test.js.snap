      Hello!
      <br />
      I am an American-born Filipino from Los Angeles County who graduated from CSU Long Beach with a business degree. Currently, I have decided to expand my skills and knowledge in a new field - web development!
      <br />
      Creating web pages has been a fun experience and as I travel along my education and career journey I am excited for what the future will bring.
      <br />
